# 📦 E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction

## 📖 Project Overview
This project predicts **customer churn** in the E-Commerce domain using **machine learning** and **data visualization**.  
The full workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values and outliers)
- Different imputation techniques: **KNN, Regression, MICE**
- Feature selection using correlation analysis
- Model training and evaluation (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting)
- Business insights visualization with **Power BI**

The goal is to help businesses **reduce churn, improve customer retention, and make data-driven decisions**.
